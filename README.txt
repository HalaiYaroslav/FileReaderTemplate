To change mappings follow the next instructions:

1. Change mapping (add/delete/update) in the file "TemplateScreenIdsToNamesMap.json". Pay attention to keep the existing file content structure.
2. Run "Rebuild.bat".
3. Run KioskScreensIdsInLogsTranslator.exe.

If you want to just run the app, execute "Run.bat" file.

!!! Run "Rebuild.bat" if it is the first run of the app.
